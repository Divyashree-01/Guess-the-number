# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. 
The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and the specified maximum value (inclusive), and the player has to guess the number.
The game provides feedback to the player if their guess is too low or too high, guiding them towards the correct answer.

## How to Play

1. Run the `guess(x)` function, where `x` is the maximum value for the range of numbers to guess from.
2. Enter your guess when prompted.
3. Receive feedback on whether your guess is too low, too high, or correct.
4. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.

## Example

If you run `guess(10)`, you'll be prompted to guess a number between 1 and 10.
The game will provide feedback based on your guesses until you correctly guess the random number.
